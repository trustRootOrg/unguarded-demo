# 2. Problem Statement

## 2.1 Blind Trust in Autonomous Agents
Autonomous agents often interact with unverified counterparties, relying on blind trust that exposes users to risks. For example, in DeFi, trading agents depend on price oracles that may be manipulated, costing protocols over $100M in 2023 due to oracle attacks.

## 2.2 Inadequate Security in Existing Solutions
Current security mechanisms, such as SSL/TLS, are insufficient for autonomous agents. Certificate issuers can decrypt data, and there’s no guarantee of tamper-proof execution, leaving agents vulnerable to manipulation and unauthorized access.

## 2.3 DDoS Vulnerabilities and Fraud Risks
Agents are susceptible to DDoS attacks and fraudulent interactions, as there’s no mechanism to filter unverified requests. This undermines the reliability of Web3 automation, particularly in high-stakes environments like DeFi and DAOs.
