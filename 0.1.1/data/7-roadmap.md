# 7. Roadmap

## 7.1 Testnet Phase (Q2-Q3 2025)
- Launch the testnet, enabling developers to certify agents/oracles, query attestations, and participate in governance.
- Distribute $TROOT rewards from the Ecosystem Incentives allocation (400M $TROOT): 1,000 $TROOT per certified agent/oracle, 200 $TROOT bonus for early governance participation, 500 $TROOT for registering 5+ solutions within 6 months.
- Run a “TrustRoot Oracle Challenge” to encourage developers to build oracles for DeFi, gaming, and other use cases, such as the TrustRoot Oracle for ETH/USD price feeds, funded by the Governance and Community allocation (200M $TROOT).
- Begin vesting for Team and Advisors allocation (150M $TROOT) with a 6-month cliff starting Q3 2025.

## 7.2 Pilot Integrations (Q4 2025-Q1 2026)
- Partner with leading projects (e.g., Aave, Damus, Optimism Collective) to integrate TrustRoot-powered solutions, such as a price feed oracle for Aave built by a third-party project like TrustOracle, funded by the Ecosystem Development Fund (150M $TROOT).
- Publish case studies showcasing security, transparency, and reliability improvements.

## 7.3 Mainnet Launch and Ecosystem Growth (Q2-Q3 2026)
- Launch the mainnet, enabling full ecosystem participation.
- Transition to a fully protocol-only model, with third-party projects driving use case development.
- Unlock the Reserve allocation (100M $TROOT) for governance to manage future needs, such as additional incentives or protocol upgrades.
