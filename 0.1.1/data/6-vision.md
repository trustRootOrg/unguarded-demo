# 6. Vision for the Future

## 6.1 A World of Trusted Autonomous Agents
TrustRoot envisions a future where autonomous agents interact securely with verified counterparties, eliminating blind trust and enabling seamless Web3 automation.

## 6.2 Impact on Web3 Automation
By providing a protocol for verifiable trust, TrustRoot secures high-stakes applications in DeFi, DAOs, gaming, and IoT, driving the adoption of AI-driven automation.

## 6.3 Becoming the Standard for Agent Trust
TrustRoot aims to become the standard for agent trust, with its protocol underpinning a wide range of Web3 applications, supported by a vibrant ecosystem of third-party projects.

## 6.4 Potential for Broader Impact
While TrustRoot’s current focus is on securing autonomous agent interactions, the protocol’s principles of transparency, tamper-proof execution, and immutable registries have the potential to address broader trust challenges in Web3 and beyond. For example, end-users interacting with traditional web services often lack the ability to verify that a site or service hasn’t been tampered with, exposing them to risks like phishing, data theft, and malware distribution. In the future, TrustRoot’s EAS Registry could store a website’s source code hash for high-security applications, while the Nostr Registry could enable cost-effective registration for lower-risk services, allowing a browser extension to verify integrity in both cases. Secure Enclave technology could ensure tamper-proof execution of backend services, regardless of the registry used. This broader application of TrustRoot’s dual-registry framework could redefine trust across the digital landscape, extending its impact beyond agents to all Web3 interactions.
